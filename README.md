# The Climb
"The Climb" is a game I made in assembly as a final project for a Computer Organisation course at UTSC. The game is inspired by "Celeste".

CONTROLS:

Pressing A/D will make you start running towards the left/right

Pressing S will stop your sideways movement (left/right)

Pressing W will make you jump, if you are on a wall then you will walljump and start moving the other direction (left turns to right and vice versa)

Pressing Q/E will make you dash left/right if you have the ability to do so
